# Imagine Web App
### Creator: Dylan Miller

"Imagine" is a web app that serves as a visualization tool, enabling users to imagine and immerse themselves in their perfect day. While creating a fun and interactive experience was essential, my primary goal with this project was to gain hands-on experience with various software and technologies, including Flask, Terraform, AWS, Docker, and more. Aspiring to be a proficient DevOps engineer, projects like this have been invaluable in deepening my understanding of key technologies and honing my ability to bring ideas to life.
